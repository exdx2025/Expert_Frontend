            Treadmill Testing (TMT), also known as a stress test, is a
            diagnostic procedure used to evaluate heart function during physical
            activity. It monitors the heart's response to stress by recording
            heart rate, blood pressure, and ECG while walking or running on a
            treadmill. This test helps identify issues like blocked arteries or
            irregular heart rhythms and assess overall cardiovascular health.
