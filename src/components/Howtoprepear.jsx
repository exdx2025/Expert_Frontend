              The preparation for an ultrasound varies based on the organ or area being examined. For abdominal organs such as the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, or spleen, you may be advised to have a light meal the night before and fast until the procedure, though drinking water and taking prescribed medications is usually allowed. For other areas, you might need to drink plenty of water and keep your bladder full. Be sure to follow your doctorâ€™s instructions and clarify any questions beforehand.
