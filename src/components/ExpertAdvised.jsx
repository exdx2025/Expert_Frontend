              Becoming an expert in diagnostics requires sharp clinical
              reasoning, continuous learning, and staying updated with
              advancements in medical science. It involves thoroughly reviewing
              patient history, conducting detailed physical examinations, and
              interpreting test results with precision. Expert diagnosticians
              excel in creating comprehensive differential diagnoses, ensuring
              no condition is overlooked. Collaboration with specialists and
              awareness of cognitive biases are crucial to avoid errors and
              refine judgment.
